# NEO_statAnalysis
Conducted statistical analysis of Hazardous Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs) to  identify key parameters contributing to their hazard potential.  Developed and implemented a Machine Learning Model to model the impact of  different parameters on NEA hazard potential, leading to more accurate  predictions of future asteroid impacts.
