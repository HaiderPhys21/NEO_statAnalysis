## Overview

This project explores Near Earth Objects (NEOs), particularly asteroids, to assess their potential hazard to Earth through data-driven statistical analysis. Using publicly available datasets and Python-based tools, we analyze orbital and physical properties of asteroids and apply logistic regression to model their hazard classification.

## Objectives

- **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Acquire NEO data, clean it using Excel Power Query and Python.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze variable distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Examine how size, orbit, and type relate to hazard potential.
- **Logistic Regression**: Train a model to classify whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous.
- **Insights & Conclusion**: Summarize findings and their implications for planetary defense.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HaiderPhys21/NEO_statAnalysis.git


2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis**
   Explore Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory, which walk through:

   * Data cleaning
   * EDA
   * Logistic regression modeling
