## Introduction

Welcome to the Near Earth Objects (NEOs) Statistical Analysis Project! In this project, we delve into the fascinating realm of near-Earth objects, particularly asteroids, with the aim of understanding their potential hazards and uncovering insights through data analysis and statistical techniques. NEOs, including asteroids and comets, can pose a threat to our planet due to their orbits intersecting with Earth's.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** We begin by collecting data on near-Earth objects, specifically asteroids, and then clean and organize it for analysis. Excel's power query is utilized to ensure data quality.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The next step involves a comprehensive exploration of the data. Using Python notebooks, we perform initial data inspection, analyze individual variables, and uncover relationships between variables using correlation analysis. This EDA process allows us to gain valuable insights into the dataset.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** With a clean dataset and insights from EDA, we dive into statistical analysis. We investigate various aspects such as the relationship between asteroid size and hazard potential, orbital characteristics' influence on hazard potential, and comparisons among different asteroid types and their characteristics.

4. **Logistic Regression Modeling:** To predict the hazard potential of NEOs, we employ a logistic regression model. This machine learning approach allows us to assess the likelihood of an asteroid being hazardous based on its attributes. We discuss the model's performance and interpret the results.

5. **Conclusion and Implications:** The project concludes with a comprehensive summary of our findings. We emphasize the importance of continued research and monitoring of NEOs, particularly hazardous asteroids. Our insights can aid in devising strategies for mitigating potential impacts and ensuring planetary safety.

## Getting Started

To explore and replicate our analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NEOs-Statistical-Analysis.git`.
